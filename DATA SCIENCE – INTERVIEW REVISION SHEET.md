 DATA SCIENCE – INTERVIEW REVISION SHEET

1️⃣ What is Data Science?
> “Data science is the process of using data, statistics, and machine learning to extract insights and build predictive or decision-making models.”

Difference from Data Analytics:
- Data Analytics → past & present (what/why)
- Data Science → future & automation (what will happen)

2️⃣ Data Science Lifecycle (Very Important)
1. Business problem understanding
2. Data collection
3. Data cleaning & preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature engineering
6. Model building
7. Model evaluation
8. Deployment & monitoring
Interview line:
> “I always start from business understanding, not the model.”

3️⃣ Data Types
- Structured → tables, SQL
- Semi-structured → JSON, logs
- Unstructured → text, images

4️⃣ Statistics You MUST Know
- Central tendency: Mean, Median (use when outliers exist)
- Spread: Variance, Standard deviation
- Correlation ≠ causation
- Normal distribution
- Skewness (income → right skewed)

5️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Steps you should say in interviews:
1. Handle missing values
2. Remove duplicates
3. Treat outliers
4. Encode categorical variables
5. Scale numerical data
Scaling:
- Min-Max → bounded range
- Standardization → normal distribution

6️⃣ Feature Engineering (Interview Favorite)
> “Feature engineering is creating meaningful input variables that improve model performance.”
Examples:
- Extract month from date
- Create customer lifetime value
- Binning age groups

7️⃣ Machine Learning Basics
- Supervised learning: Regression, Classification
- Unsupervised learning: Clustering, Dimensionality reduction

8️⃣ Common Algorithms (Know WHEN to use)
- Regression: Linear regression → continuous output
- Classification: Logistic regression, Decision tree, Random forest, SVM
- Unsupervised: K-Means → segmentation, PCA → dimensionality reduction

9️⃣ Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Overfitting → model memorizes training data
- Underfitting → model too simple
Fixes:
- Regularization
- More data
- Cross-validation

🔟 Model Evaluation Metrics
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC
- Regression: MAE, RMSE
Interview line:
> “Metric selection depends on business problem.”

1️⃣1️⃣ Imbalanced Data Techniques
- Class weighting
- Oversampling / undersampling
- SMOTE
- Metric preference: Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC

1️⃣2️⃣ Python for Data Science
Core libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
Must know:
- loc vs iloc
- Groupby
- Vectorization

1️⃣3️⃣ Model Deployment (Basic Understanding)
- Batch prediction
- Real-time prediction
- Model monitoring
- Model drift
Interview line:
> “Models must be monitored because data changes over time.”

1️⃣4️⃣ Explain Your Project (Template)
> “The goal was _. I cleaned the data using _. I performed EDA to identify _. I built _ model and evaluated using _. The final outcome was _.”

1️⃣5️⃣ HR-Style Data Science Answers
Why data science?
> “I enjoy solving complex problems using data and building models that automate decisions.”
Biggest challenge:
“Handling messy real-world data.”
Strength:
“Strong foundation in statistics and ML.”

🔥 LAST-DAY INTERVIEW TIPS
- Explain intuition, not math
- Don’t jump to algorithms immediately
- Always connect model → business value
- Say assumptions clearly



Machine Learning Basics – Must-Know Concepts 🤖📊  

1️⃣ What is Machine Learning?  
📌 A branch of AI where systems learn patterns from data without explicit programming.  
💡 Goal: Make predictions or decisions based on past data.

2️⃣ Types of ML  
– Supervised Learning: Labeled data → predicts outcomes (e.g., spam detection)  
– Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)  
– Reinforcement Learning: Learns via rewards/punishments (e.g., game AI)

3️⃣ Key Algorithms  
– Linear Regression → predicts continuous values  
– Logistic Regression → predicts probabilities/class  
– Decision Trees → interpretable classification/regression  
– K-Means → clustering similar data points  
– Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting → advanced predictive models

4️⃣ Model Evaluation Metrics  
– Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score (classification)  
– RMSE, MAE (regression)  
– Confusion Matrix → visualize true vs predicted labels

5️⃣ Feature Engineering  
⚙️ Transform raw data into meaningful inputs  
💡 Examples: normalization, encoding categorical variables, handling missing data

6️⃣ Overfitting vs Underfitting  
🔺 Overfitting → model too complex, memorizes training data  
🔻 Underfitting → model too simple, misses patterns
🛠 Solutions: Regularization, cross-validation, more data

7️⃣ Training & Testing Split  
📊 Split data into train (learn) and test (evaluate) sets to measure performance.

8️⃣ Popular Tools & Libraries  
– Python: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy  
– R, MATLAB for specialized ML tasks
