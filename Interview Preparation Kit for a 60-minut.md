Focus Areas: (Any Mix of the topics may be covered)


Prompt Engineering

LLM Fine-Tuning

Multi-Agent Systems (CrewAI / LangChain / Autogen)

Vector Databases (ChromaDB / FAISS)

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Agents

Embedding Models & RAG Design

🧠 Key Areas to Prepare

✅ 1. Prompt Engineering


Prompt types: zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought

Prompt optimization: clarity, specificity, role instructions

Tools for prompt testing: LangSmith, PromptLayer

Evaluation techniques: hallucination checks, response consistency

Sample Questions:


What makes a prompt robust across edge cases?

How would you craft a prompt to extract tabular data from an unstructured text?

✅ 2. Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)


Supervised fine-tuning vs. instruction tuning

LoRA, QLoRA, PEFT: parameter-efficient techniques

Datasets: Cleaning, preprocessing, tokenization

Libraries: HuggingFace transformers, datasets, accelerate

Sample Questions:


Explain how you fine-tuned a model for a domain-specific task.

What are the trade-offs between fine-tuning and in-context learning?

✅ 3. Multi-Agent Systems (CrewAI / LangChain / Autogen)


Agent types: Planner, Executor, Critic, Coder, Retriever, etc.

Communication & memory between agents

Use cases: Research assistants, decision-makers, autonomous workflows

Framework comparison:


CrewAI: More structured orchestration

Autogen: Chat-based agent interaction

LangChain: Tool-based agents



Sample Questions:


Describe a project where you implemented agent collaboration.

How would you handle error correction in multi-agent coordination?

✅ 4. Vector Databases & Embeddings


Common options: ChromaDB, FAISS, Weaviate, Qdrant

Indexing strategies: Flat, HNSW, IVF

Embedding models: OpenAI, BGE, Instructor-XL

Storage considerations: metadata filtering, hybrid search

Sample Questions:


How would you choose between FAISS and ChromaDB for a real-time app?

How do you monitor embedding quality and drift over time?

✅ 5. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)


Components: Embed → Store → Retrieve → Generate

Chunking strategies: semantic vs. fixed-size

Tools: LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom pipelines

Use cases: Long-document QA, knowledge bots, support automation

Sample Questions:


Describe a RAG architecture you’ve implemented.

How do you ensure retrieval relevance in noisy document sets?

✅ 6. Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autonomous Agents


Algorithms: PPO, DQN, A3C (basic familiarity expected)

Use in LLM systems: dynamic tool selection, task optimization

Comparison with RLHF: reward tuning vs. human feedback

Frameworks: OpenAI Gym, RLlib, CleanRL

Sample Questions:


How would you apply RL to improve an agent’s task success rate?

What’s the biggest challenge when using RL in LLM-based agents?
