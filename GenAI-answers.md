Here are model-answer outlines for each of the 20 intermediate Generative AI technical questions:

1. **Handling data imbalance:** 
   - Situation: Common in real datasets.
   - Task: Ensure model fairness and accuracy.
   - Action: Use techniques like oversampling, undersampling, synthetic data generation, or cost-sensitive training.
   - Result: Improved model performance across classes.

2. **Pre-training vs fine-tuning:** 
   - Pre-training: Model learns general features from large datasets.
   - Fine-tuning: Adjusting the model on task-specific, often smaller datasets.
   - Purpose: Transfer learning to improve task effectiveness.

3. **“Temperature” in text generation:** 
   - Controls randomness.
   - Low temperature = more conservative outputs.
   - High temperature = diverse, creative but riskier outputs.

4. **Embeddings:** 
   - Vector representations capturing semantic meaning.
   - Crucial for similarity search, clustering, input for downstream tasks.

5. **GANs working:** 
   - Generator creates fake samples.
   - Discriminator distinguishes fake vs real.
   - Both networks trained adversarially to improve generation.

6. **Eager vs graph execution (TensorFlow):**
   - Eager: Immediate execution for ease of debugging.
   - Graph: Builds computation graph for optimization and speed.

7. **Attention and self-attention:** 
   - Attention helps focus on relevant parts of input.
   - Self-attention enables capturing dependencies within input sequences.
   - Vital for Transformers’ performance.

8. **Mitigating bias:** 
   - Data balancing, debiasing algorithms, fairness-aware training.
   - Regular monitoring and evaluation.

9. **Prompt engineering:** 
   - Crafting inputs to guide model outputs.
   - Key for LLMs’ performance and task-specific adaptation.

10. **Controlling hallucinations:** 
    - Use retrieval-augmented methods.
    - Post-processing, fact-checking, controlled generation.

11. **Latent space in generative models:** 
    - Compressed space encoding data features.
    - Exploration and manipulation enable generation diversity.

12. **Stability in GAN training:** 
    - Techniques like Wasserstein loss, gradient penalty, progressive growing of GANs.

13. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and chunking:** 
    - RAG combines retrieval with generation.
    - Chunking large documents helps efficient retrieval and processing.

14. **Privacy and security in Gen AI:** 
    - Data anonymization, secure model hosting, API key management.

15. **Zero-shot vs few-shot learning:** 
    - Zero-shot: No task-specific examples.
    - Few-shot: Limited examples for task adaptation.

16. **Optimizing token usage:** 
    - Prompt trimming, batching, caching frequent queries.

17. **Evaluation metrics:** 
    - FID for images, BLEU, ROUGE for text, human evaluation.

18. **Designing chatbot with LLMs:** 
    - Consider context management, response relevance, latency, fallback strategies.

19. **Adversarial attacks and defenses:** 
    - Data poisoning, perturbation attacks.
    - Defense via robust training, detection mechanisms.

20. **Cloud infrastructure for Gen AI:** 
    - Scalability, distributed training.
    - Storage and compute optimization.
